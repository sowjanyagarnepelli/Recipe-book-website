            <div class="about-recipe">
                <p>Fajitas are a Tex-Mex specialty known for their sizzling and savory appeal. Typically made with grilled or sautéed strips of marinated beef, chicken, or shrimp, they are served with sautéed bell peppers and onions. Fajitas are often accompanied by warm tortillas and an array of toppings like guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and cheese, allowing diners to create their customized, flavorful wraps</p>

            <ul class="ingredient-list">
                <li>250 gr. chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove</li>
                <li> ½ onion</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 flour pancakes per person</li>
                <li>Grated cheese</li>
                <li>Mexican hot sauce</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">How to Make It:</h2>
            <ol class="instruction-list">
                <li>Wash the onion well and chop it into small pieces, just like you do with the garlic clove and the red pepper. If you see that it costs you a lot to chop them, you pass them through the crusher. Once ready, you put them to fry in a pan with olive oil.</li>
                <li>Wash the chicken breasts with water, so you remove some of the fat and cut them into small pieces. When you see that the onion is transparent, you throw and fry everything together, until the chicken pieces have the color you like.</li>
                <li>Pour a little hot sauce into the pan and stir, so the sauce will be well integrated into the meat.</li>
                <li>Spread a pancake, top it with the Mexican hot sauce and some grated cheese. Put the filling, coat again with sauce and grated cheese. Roll it a little and you will have your dish ready.</li>
                <li>You just have to repeat the procedure until you run out of pancakes or filling.</li>
